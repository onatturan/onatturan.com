        <h1>Bio – About Me</h1>
        <p><strong>My name is Onat Turan</strong>, a passionate software developer and athlete who thrives on challenges. My journey started in sports, where I played basketball and American football at the college level before fully committing to bodybuilding. I have spent over a decade training like a soldier—physically and mentally—always pushing my limits. However, my passion extends beyond fitness; I am deeply fascinated by technology and software development.</p>

        <p>I pursued <strong>Computer Programming and Analysis</strong> at George Brown College, where I developed expertise in full-stack development, artificial intelligence, and data science. I love solving complex problems, optimizing systems, and building innovative projects that merge human performance with cutting-edge technology. My long-term goal is to create humanoid robots that assist people in their daily lives, making technology more intuitive and accessible.</p>

        <p>Every line of code I write and every rep I complete in the gym reflects my relentless pursuit of growth. Whether I’m building a new application, analyzing data, or training for a competition, I believe in constantly evolving and pushing the boundaries of what’s possible.</p>
